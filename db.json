            "description": "During the 5th Century BCE, Siddhartha Gautama was born. In Sanskrit, Siddhartha means \u2018He Who Achieves His Goal.\u2019 Siddhartha was born into royalty and soon realised that living a conditioned life was not going to bring eternal happiness or protection from suffering. After coming face to face with suffering, Siddhartha decided to leave his royal duties on the quest for enlightenment. He left secretly and over six years, practiced with meditation teachers and finally decided to remain in meditation underneath the Bodhi Tree until, after conquering much fear and temptation, he reached enlightenment.He became Buddha, The Awakened One, and has been signified by Buddha statues for centuries. Buddha statues are more than a physical depiction of Buddha, they all have meaning. Each pose, posture, expression and hand gesture is significant to the life of Buddha. There are over 100 different poses that illustrate the life of Buddha, also called an asana or attitude, and hand gestures are referred to as a Mudra. The identification of standing Buddha poses is quite simple, because the Buddha is either standing or walking. The most popular of these standing Buddha statues is known as \u2013 Sukothai \u2013 and they originated in 13th century Thailand. The Buddha hand gestures reveal the standing Buddha statue meaning. The most common Buddha poses used by a standing Buddha statue are the Varada \u201cgift giving\u201d and Abhaya \u201cprotection\u201d mudras. Therefore, the standing Buddha statue meaning is meant to inspire devotees with the generosity and fearless nature of the Buddhas. The historical Buddha often used the standing Buddha posture after he obtained enlightenment. Additionally, it is also common for standing Buddha statues to display the Abhaya \u201cprotection\u201d mudra with both hands instead of only one.",

            "description": "Ganesha also known as Ganapati and Vinayaka, is one of the best-known and most worshipped deities in the Hindu pantheon. His image is found throughout India, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Bali (Indonesia) and Bangladesh and in countries with large ethnic Indian populations including Fiji, Mauritius and Trinidad and Tobago.Hindu denominations worship him regardless of affiliations. Devotion to Ganesha is widely diffused and extends to Jains and Buddhists. Although he is known by many attributes, Ganesha's elephant head makes him easy to identify. Ganesha is widely revered as the remover of obstacles, the patron of arts and sciences and the deva of intellect and wisdom. As the god of beginnings, he is honoured at the start of rites and ceremonies. Ganesha is also invoked as patron of letters and learning during writing sessions. Several texts relate mythological anecdotes associated with his birth and exploits. Ganesha likely emerged as a deity as early as the 1st century CE, but most certainly by the 4th and 5th centuries CE, during the Gupta period, although he inherited traits from Vedic and pre-Vedic precursors. Hindu mythology identifies him as the restored son of Parvati and Shiva of the Shaivism tradition, but he is a pan-Hindu god found in its various traditions. In the Ganapatya tradition of Hinduism, Ganesha is the supreme deity.The principal texts on Ganesha include the Ganesha Purana, the Mudgala Purana, and the Ganapati Atharvashirsa. Brahma Purana and Brahmanda Purana are other two Puranic genre encyclopaedic texts that deal with Ganesha.",

Lord Surya is considered as the evident god as it could be seen with bare eyes. Surya rides on a chariot pulled by seven horses. Surya is known by many alternative names and epithets which include Vivasvat (Brilliant), Savitr (the Nourisher), Bhaskara (Light-maker), Dinakara (Day-maker), Lokacaksuh (Eye of the World), Graharaja (King of the Constellations), and Sahasra-kirana (Of a 1,000 rays).Surya firstappears in literature in the Rigveda, oldest of the Vedas.

            "description": "The divine inspiration behind Tara statues is a renown Buddhist deity that first appeared in the \u201cPrajnaparamita Sutra\u201d. However, the meaning of Tara statues found in the sutra was vague and mostly coincided with the rapidly evolving popularity of Mahayana Buddhism. Eventually, about 5 centuries later, her essence evolved to become expressed as the \u201ccompassion of perfected wisdom\u201d. As a result, the first identifiable standing Tara statue appeared in the 7th century ACE. This Tara statue is still viewable today at cave 6 in the Ellora Cave complex located at Maharashtra India. Although this stone image is rather plain, the character and appearance of Tara statues would soon become much more elaborate. The worship of Tara statues spread rapidly with the rise of the Pala Empire in 8th century India. As a result, worship of the Tara Goddess would take root in both Mahayana and the more progressive Tibetan Buddhism. In Tibetan Buddhism, Tara was born from a teardrop that fell from the eye of Avalokiteshvara. Tibetan Buddhists also believe that she is the female aspect and consort of Avalokiteshvara. However, Tara is also fiercely independent and she is arguably the world\u2019s first feminist. The Tara bodhisattva vowed to refuse reincarnation as a male until there were more female Buddhas.",

The Dhyani Buddhas are a peculiar kind of Buddhas who are not required to pass through the stage of a bodhisattva; they were never anything less than a Buddha. They are always engaged in peaceful meditation, and they voluntarily restrain themselves from creation. To create is the duty of their emanations, the divine bodhisattvas.

Prajnaparamita's iconography has been described in the nine sadhanas (nos. 151-59) in the Sadhanamala, describing her two-and four-armed forms ",

The tripartite structure of votive stupas comprises the superstructure, dome, and foundation. This votive stupa consists of various Buddhist deities, giving an impression of a mandala, as determined from their iconographic placement. Although the iconography shows variations from the textual tradition, the stupa exudes artistic creativity and the evolving impact of tantric rituals in the cultural and artistic realms. The harmika is represented with the four Transcendental Buddha figures in different mudras, facing each cardinal direction, symbolizing their omnipresence. Above the harmika is placed the circular parasol (chattra). The dome bears four structural shaped niches containing a Buddha in bhumisparsha mudra and three Bodhisattva figures, one of them in a contemplative mood. Like the pyramidal roof of the harmika and the decorative fa\u00e7ade of the pavillions, the architectural elements exhibit the influence of Odishan architecture. The base is rendered with square projecting niches, three on each side, containing twelve divinities. The central register displays a combination of tantric deities, such as Hayagriva, Vajrapani, Yamantaka, and Manjushri, flanked by two-armed female deities seated cross-legged with a lotus stalk in one hand and the other in the boon-granting pose (varada mudra).

The second panel depicts Mara with his three daughters and other members of his retinue attempting to distract Siddhartha from his penance while the latter invites the Earth to witness his attainment of bodhijnana; the female figure below his seat is mother Earth and the snake next to her is Kala, who came to wish the sage as he meditated. 3. The third panel depicts the nimbate Buddha seated in pralambapada on a lotus in dharmachakra mudra delivering his sermon in the deer park at Sarnath. He is flanked by Vajrapani and Maitreya. 4. The topmost panel depicts the mahaparinirvana, the great demise of the Buddha. His body is laid on the couch which is surrounded by mourning devotees. While individual scenes from the Buddha's life were depicted separately, it was during this period that such a sequential presentation was introduced by Sarnath.",

This sculpture of the Manjukumara form, datable to the second quarter of the seventh century, depicts the crispness and refinement of the Nalanda style. The details are exuberantly carved as seen in the treatment of the ornaments, clothing, and features such as the swirling foliage at the base of the lotus steam, which recall the Gupta tradition.",

The tradition of venerating buddhapada continues till modern day in Buddhist monasteries in India, Southeast and Fareast Asia. This Buddhapada from Nagarjunakonda stupa was used as an object of devotion as well as a narrative means for the built structure of the stupa. The footmarks are highly ornate and covered entirely with auspicious signs and symbols. Most prominent of these markings are the large chakras or wheels. Chakras on the soles of the feet are said to be one of the thirty-two super-human qualities (mahapurusha lakshanas) associated with Buddha. Lotus flowers (padma) adorn the centre of the wheel, the lotus being a symbol of the purity of Buddha. The footprints artistically illustrate some of the auspicious motifs, starting from the top left corner we see, the shrivatsa, bhadrasana, swastika, purna kumbha, shankha, matsyayugma, triratna, among others.

            "description": "The Narasimha avatara is one of the ten incarnations of Lord Vishnu. It is always represented in a hybrid form. The face is that of a lion (simha) and the body being human (nara). The story behind this incarnation goes as follows Prahlada, who was a great devotee of Hari (another name for Vishnu) was tortured by his demon father Hiranyakashyapu, a great hater of Hari. After his vain efforts through persuasion and severe persecution to dissuade Prahlada from his devotion to Hari, asked him where his god was. Prahlada answered that he was everywhere, even in the crystal column before them. Hiranyakashyapu kicked at it, and out came the god in the peculiar form, felled the demon on his thighs and killed him outright. Many reliefs depicting this theme have been recovered from various parts of India, and a large number of them represent either the combat between the god and the demon or the killing of the latter.Image of Narasimha shown standing on a semi-circular pedestal. He is lion-faced. He wears a necklace, the sacred chord, udarabandha and anklets. A sash is draped around the thighs and its loop is held in the left hand. ",

When Shiva cut off one of the heads of Brahma he incurred the sin of killing a brahmana and the skull of Brahma it is stated stuck to Shiva\u2019s palm and would not drop down. In order to get rid of the sin and this incriminating skull, Shiva had to wander around as a naked beggar (Bhikshatana) until he reached the place still known as brahma-kapalam on the slopes of the Himalayas, where he was released from the sin and the skull fell down of its ownaccord. The Chola dynasty was one of the longest-ruling dynasties in history. The Cholas continued the temple-building traditions of the Pallava dynasty and contributed significantly to the Dravidian temple design. They built a number of Shiva temples along the banks of the river Kaveri. The Chola period is also remarkable for its sculptures and bronzes.

Shiva suddenly appeared before them in the form of a blazing column of fire. Brahma and Vishnu tried respectively to find its top and bottom, but they failed. Brahma, however falsely asserted that he had succeeded in his effort, for which Shiva cursed him never to have a cult of his own. Vishnu confessed his inability to find the bottom of the column; Shiva, who had in meanwhile become manifest in it, blessed him to have his own sect almost equal in importance to that of himself. This theme undoubtedly revealing a sectarian bias was very much popular with the Indian artists of the early and late medieval periods. An image of Lingodhbhava Shiva made in granite stone.

Pala dynasty, ruling in Bihar and Bengal, India, from the 8th to the 12th century. Its founder, Gopala, was a local chieftain who rose to power in the mid-8th century during a period of anarchy. His successor, Dharmapala (reigned c. 770\u2013810), greatly expanded the kingdom and for a while was in control of Kannauj. The Palas were supporters of Buddhism, and it was through missionaries from their kingdom that Buddhism was finally established in Tibet. Under Pala patronage a distinctive school of art arose, of which many noteworthy sculptures in stone and metal survive.

The central panel depicts Buddha's worship through the presence of an empty throne sheltered by a five-headed Naga Muchalinda under a tree decorated with garland streamers. Fearing harm to the Buddha during the rainy season, King Naga Muchalinda rose above the regurgitating waters and coiling himself around Buddha\u2019s body providing shade with his hooded canopy of heads.",
